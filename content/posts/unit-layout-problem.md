# Massing Problem Section 1

The problem of finding the appropriate volumetric design of the building is the highest level of the space layout problem. In this stage the impact of placing volumes representing the built mass on the site is studied with respect to its effect on the surrounding buildings as well as its own performance in achieving the urban level design goals.

# Aim

To generate various massing variants for the site and select a variant which will maximise the site utilization without compromising on the quality of the spaces as defined by the architect.

```python


# Python Program to find the area of triangle

a = 5
b = 6
c = 7

# Uncomment below to take inputs from the user
# a = float(input('Enter first side: '))
# b = float(input('Enter second side: '))
# c = float(input('Enter third side: '))

# calculate the semi-perimeter
s = (a + b + c) / 2

# calculate the area
area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)

```
