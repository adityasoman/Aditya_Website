# The 3D Layout Problem

The Unit detailing problem deals with generation of design details for the units developed in the unit layout problem. Design details may consists of the following things . Materials and components of the various infill layers in the unit like Walls, Windows, facades, floors, ceilings, installations, furniture's etc. The clear distinction between the structure and infill has been made in the open building concept and the infill layer is the main element which will be detailed in the unit detailing problem. The structure layer should ideally be resolved in the unit assignment problem itself so at this stage there is already information regarding the structure of the building

# Aim

To generate various massing variants for the site and select a variant which will maximise the site utilization without compromising on the quality of the spaces as defined by the architect.

```python


# Python Program to find the area of triangle

a = 5
b = 6
c = 7

# Uncomment below to take inputs from the user
# a = float(input('Enter first side: '))
# b = float(input('Enter second side: '))
# c = float(input('Enter third side: '))

# calculate the semi-perimeter
s = (a + b + c) / 2

# calculate the area
area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)

```
